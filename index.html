        <h2>Additional Features (Soccer Only)</h2>
        <p>
          Notes:  I got a little enthusiastic
          with building this version, and had some fun adding some of the suggested additional gameplay</br>
          features. This demo utilizes some additional features of Rive and it's ability to send / receive from a web app portion. </br>
          The scoreboard that was added, is completely built in Rive, including the UI / buttons. Vue / JS portion listens for events fired from </br>
          the Rive portion for gameplay resets and continuing through the three attempts.</br>
          Vue / JS transmit back to the visual portion additional state updates for; attempt number, score, and toggling displaying elements. These are used</br>
          within the Rive state machine for animation handling and transitions.
        
      </br>

          <b>Football scene is disabled in this demo.</b>
